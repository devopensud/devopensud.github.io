## FAQ
*The event will be made by those who will be there*.

#### What is DevOpenSud?

Somewhere in the mountains, in the middle of nowhere some developers gathered in a cottage to talk, code, walk, pair, collaborate, play, cook, do things...

#### Who organise that thing?

There are `s/not really/really no/` organisers.

#### How much does it cost?

We share the fees, probably about 60 euros a day or 200 for the 4 days.

#### Can I come to work during the day and play with you at night?

We're going to do things together, maybe you'll need a little space apart.
But, yes you can do your stuff at Dev Open Sud.

#### Can I expect a good Internet connection?

It's usually very variable, so not good.
Remember to download before coming.

#### Should I pay something now?

Nope. We trust you. You'll pay everything at the end of the event.

#### Can I have an invoice?

Yes, we can make you a nice bill.

#### Where do I sign?

Registration is here: [subscribe](https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io/edit/master/inscriptions.md).

#### How many people will be there?

Maybe 10, maximum 20, probably around 12.

#### What will we eat?

It is not decided yet. But if you have some food constraints (no gluten, allergies, vegan, ...) please, tell us as soon as possible so we can consider it.

#### By the way, where is it?

The place isn't yet defined. Certainly in the Alps or the Massif Central.
Don't hesitate to propose a good address.

## But your English is awful?

Yes, we know. We are French. But we will be very happy if you help us improve this page (and our bad English): [https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io](https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io).

## You will maximise your chances of satisfaction if

* you organise yourself and don't rely only on the non-organisers
* you follow the [law of two feet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Law_of_two_feet)
* you know that those who will be there will be the right ones.
