## FAQ

#### What is DevOpenSud?

Somewhere in the Alps, in the middle of nowhere some developers gathered in a cottage to talk, code, walk, pair, collaborate, play, cook, do things...

#### Who organise that thing?

There are `s/not really/really no/` organisers.

#### How much does it cost?

We don't know exactly yet, but it won't be above 200 euros (tax excl).

#### What is included for that price?

From Thursday, August 31th in the morning to Sunday, September 3th: all your meals and bed.

#### Can I come to work during the day and play with you at night?

Yes, Dev Open Sud 2017 is also meant to be an ephemeral co-working space.

#### Should I pay something now?

Nope. We trust you. You'll pay everything at the end of the event.

#### Can I have an invoice?

Yes, we can do that.

#### Where do I sign?

Registration is here: [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/devopensud-2017-2-registration-36026739949).

#### How many people will be there?

Maybe 10, maximum 20, probably around 12.

#### Is there some carpooling planned to reach the event?

Well, `we` won't plan anything, but `you` can use the mailing list [devopensud-2016@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/devopensud-2016) to organise it :)

#### How are the room?

There are 8 rooms, from 1 to 9 beds. Some are bunk beds, some are single bed or double bed. [Some pictures of the rooms](http://www.grangedebrudour.com/crbst_1.html).

#### Can I have a room with no snorer?

You probably could find a way to organise a room with no snorer. But it may be a good idea to come with earplugs :)

#### What will we eat?

It is not decided yet. But if you have some food constraints (no gluten, allergies, vegan, ...) please, tell us as soon as possible so we can consider it.
